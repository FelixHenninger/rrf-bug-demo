## Demonstration of [react-redux-form issue #592](https://github.com/davidkpiano/react-redux-form/issues/592)

This is a minimal app, based on the [very first example in the react-redux-form docs](https://davidkpiano.github.io/react-redux-form/docs.html). It demonstrates that, for two identical components, the form event handlers are triggered on updates only within the component that is not connected to a [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/) store.

The demo can be run using `npm install && npm start`. The browser should then open, and show two sets username/password fields. Both represent the same component, however the first has been connected to a redux store using [connect](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.md#implementing-container-components), making it a container component. By typing in both sets of fields, you should see that the data below is updated only on the bottom, unconnected, copy, but not on the first, which differs merely by its wrapper.
